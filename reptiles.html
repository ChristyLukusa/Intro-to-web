A Lot of Variety
Reptiles and amphibians fall in the category of exotic pets,
 and as such, you'll need to check your local regulations to 
determine which ones are legal for you to keep as pets. As a general
 rule, it's probably legal to keep anything that's sold at
 one of the major pet store chains, but you'll need to be more 
careful if you're purchasing from a private dealer. There are many 
animals in this group to choose from, and some of the most popular choices include,Snakes
,Turtles,Tortoises ,Lizards ,Salamander ,Newts ,Frogs and Toads. 
Your first job is to study any of these animals that interest you to learn more
 about them. You'll find a number of articles on individual species in this category,
 and more info will be added as time goes on.

<h2>*Understand the Risks Involved*</h2>
To say that amphibians and reptiles are not your average pets is an understatement, 
and there are certain risks associated with keeping them.
While some pet snakes are relatively docile, you still need to 
take care handling them because getting bitten is a possibility. Some species,
 like fire-bellied toads, release toxins. Other species, especially turtles and lizards, 
shed salmonella bacteria in their feces which can sicken the average adult and can even 
prove fatal to small children, senior citizens and anyone with a compromised immune system.
