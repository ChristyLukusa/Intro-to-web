<h1> Dietary/Food Choices </h1>
<p>
</p>

<h2> Mammals </h2>
<h3>Gerbils and Hamsters</h3>
<ul>
<li>Amount: Your pet should only eat approximately one tablespoon or less 
of mix per day. Feeding at the same time each day is a good habit for 
both of you to get into.
</li>
<li>
Treats: Treats are designed to be an extremely small element of the animal’s
 diet. Unshelled nuts, all sorts, are a good item to keep as a treat
 for your pet.
</li>
<li>
Vitamins: A specially formulated vitamin supplement will ensure your
 hamster or gerbil receives all the necessary vitamins and minerals to
 live a long, healthy life.
</li>
<li>
Foods to Avoid: Iceberg lettuce, tomatoes, chocolate, raw beans, potatoes, 
as well as sugary or salty foods.  Too much green food will cause diarrhea.  
Never give sticky food to a hamster, as it will stick to their pouches.
</li>
</ul>

<h3> Guinea Pigs </h3>
<ul>
<li>Amount: The recommended daily feeding requirement of commercial guinea pig 
feed is 1/8 cup of pellets per two-pound guinea pig, plus greens. Feeding should 
occur every morning and evening.</li>
<li>Treats: In moderation, fruits such as apples, apricots, bananas, berries, 
cherries, grapes, kiwi, melon, oranges, pears and strawberries are healthy treats 
for guinea pigs.</li>
<li>Vitamins: Guinea pigs, like humans, are missing an enzyme that the body needs
 to make Vitamin C. A diet heavy in Vitamin C, in addition to drops added to their 
water, will help to make up for this deficiency. The minimum daily requirement for 
Vitamin C for your guinea pig is 10-30 mg per day. Like rabbits, they handle part 
of their nutrition on their own, producing nutrient-rich cecotropes that they eat
 directly from the anal area.</li>
Foods to Avoid: Long celery stalks should be avoided; the “strings” in celery are 
difficult to digest. Iceberg is on many of the “Avoid” lists because it is high in 
nitrates and has virtually no nutritional value.  Raw beans and rhubarb are poisonous 
to these small animals.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Rabbits</h3>
<ul>
<li>Amount: Pellets should be fed sparingly to prevent obesity:  only about 1/8 cup per day.
<li>Treats: Fruits such as kiwi, strawberries, pears, melons, apples, oranges and vegetables 
are recommended in limited quantities.</li>
<li>Vitamins: With a proper diet of quality rabbit feed and the above foods, vitamin supplements
 will not normally be necessary. Rabbits will obtain all the vitamins they need from their cecotropes,
 which are a special type of dropping that is eaten by the rabbit directly from the anus and then digested.
Foods to Avoid: It is best to avoid high starch or fatty foods such as beans, breads, seeds, peas, corn, nuts,
 cereals, oats or any other grains. This will keep your rabbit free of any potential problems such as 
obesity and serious gastrointestinal disease.
</ul>
<h3> Rats </h3>
<ul>
<li>Base Food: Like mice, rats do well when given a commercial rodent food as the foundation
 of their diet. Similarly, they should avoid loose food mixes. The best form for a rat is 
block food, as it provides good chewing exercise and can be available all the time, which is 
recommended. When examining foods to buy, look for blocks with soy meal as the main component; 
these blocks are better for your small pet.</li>
<li>Nutritional Benchmarks: Though mice and rat diets are very similar, rats need a slightly
 different mix. Specifically, they need more fiber and less fat. Try to make sure your rat’s food 
is easily above the 18% fiber a mouse would need and distinctly lower than the 4% fat a mouse would 
be limited to.</li>
</ul>

<h3> Mice </h3>
<ul>
<li>Base Food: A good place to start for your mouse is a commercial rodent food. These are available 
in most pet stores and can come in block, pellet, or seed mix form. It’s probably wise to stay away 
from the seed mix, as your mouse may pick and choose what to eat from it, resulting in a diet
 imbalance. The pellet and block foods work well.<li>
<li>Nutritional Benchmarks: When choosing a commercial food for your mice, you should pay attention 
to certain nutritional facts. In their food, mice need a minimum level of fiber (18%) and protein 
(16%) to stay healthy. Additionally, fat content should be limited to a maximum of 4%. Paying
 attention to these levels will help your mice stay fit.</li>
<li>Supplements and Snacks: In addition to their commercial food, your pets will enjoy a daily 
treat. Fresh fruit and vegetables are a perfect solution. Some good ideas are peas, cauliflower,
 carrots, broccoli, apples, or bananas. Be careful, though, these treats should be very small,
 to ward off overeating. You should also avoid giving your small pet cabbage, chocolate, corn, 
peanuts, beans, or onions, as these can be harmful.</li>
</ul>
<h2> Reptiles and Amphibians </h2>
<h3>Snakes</h3>
Most snakes are carnivores or insectivores. They need to eat meat and don't 
eat any fruits or vegetables for the most part. Most snakes eat some combination of:
<ul>
<li>Insects of all shapes and sizes</li>
<br>
<li>Rodents</li>
<br>
<li>Other reptiles</li>
<br>
<li>Birds</li>
<br>
<li>Larger mammals</li>
<br>
<li>Eggs, though this isn't very commom</li>
</ul>

<h3> Lizards </h3>

Species of lizard can be herbivorous (vegetarian) or omnivorous (both meat and veggies).
 Some big lizards are true predators, eating larger mammals with ease—but those aren't 
common as pets. Insectivorous lizards are probably a better choice if you’re comfortable
 with killing crickets but not rats.
<br>
In the wild, lizards might eat:
<ul>
<li>A wide variety of worms, spiders, beetles, flies, and other insects
Other small animals like baby birds, baby mice, or smaller lizards</li>
<li>Eggs</li>
<li>Fruits and veggies</li>
<li>Larger prey, depending on the size of the lizard</li>
<li>The specific diet varies a lot depending on the species of lizard.
Most people feed their lizards crickets, mealworms, or waxworm</li>
</ul>
 <h3> Frogs </h3>
<ul> 
Frogs and toads are carnivores, which means that they will eat meat. Small to medium 
sized frogs eat insects such as flies, mosquitoes, moths and dragonflies. Larger frogs 
will eat larger insects like grasshoppers and worms. Some large frogs will even eat:small
snakes, mice, baby turtles, and even other smaller frogs!
</ul>

 <h3> Turtles </h3>
These slow-moving animals prefer to eat things that can't run away, such as:
<ul>
Lettuce, 
beet greens
and other leafy greens
A variety of fruits, 
including apples, melons, and mangoes
Flowers
A wide variety of other veggies
Some aquatic turtles eat fish or insects
</ul>
Herbivorous turtles and tortoises might be appealing if you don’t like the idea of 
other animals dying to feed your pet. Turtles and tortoises often have complex nutritional
needs because they evolved to eat such a variety! Many omnivorous reptiles do best with 
a supplement or pellets to augment their fresh meals.

<h2> Birds </h2>
lacing a variety of seeds and other foods in a dish and expecting your feathered companion
 to pick out a balanced diet doesn’t work. Birds do not have the ability to choose a proper 
diet, so it’s up to the owner to provide balanced nutrition. Bird pellets are the most well-balanced,
 complete food available today. Your local pet supply store most likely carries several brands 
of these pellets, which are similar in appearance and design to dry dog and cat food
<ul>
<li> Apples, grapes and bananas make good fruit choices.</li> 
<li> Avoid feeding your bird citrus fruits unless specifically recommended by your avian veterinarian.</li>
 <li> Keep the amount of table food you offer to a minimum. </li>
 <li> Never give your birds chocolate, wine and liquor, caffeinated beverages, avocados or very spicy foods.</li>
</ul>
<h2> Fish </h2>
Fish food these days might be expensive but in order for your fish to live a long and
healthy life, money cannot be a problem.
<ul>
<li>TetraMin Tropical Flakes </li>
<br>
<li> New Life Spectrum Thera-A Medium 2mm </li>
<br>
<li> Hikari Tropical Semi-Floating Micro Pellets.</li>
<br>
<li>TetraVeggie Algae Wafers </li>
<br>
<li> Zoo Med Spirulina 20 Flake </li>
<br>
<li> Omega One Veggie Rounds </li>
<br>
<li>TetraCichlid Cichlid Flakes </li>
<br>
<li> Hikari Bio-Pure Freeze Dried Blood Worms </li>
</ul>

<h3> Hermit Crab </h3>
Well-balanced hermit crab diet consists of:
<ul>
<li> High-quality commercial hermit crab food.</li>
<li> Recommend vegetables (spinach, carrots and romaine lettuce) and noncitrus fruits (mangoes, coconut and papaya) as treats.</li>
<li>Nuts, seaweed, brine shrimp and fish flakes can also be offered as treats.</li>
<li> Provide carotene and calcium supplements (such as cuttlebone).</li>
</ul>
